## How It Works 🧠
The tooltip app incorporates background calculations to determine whether the tooltip can fit on the screen with the specified parameters. It takes into account the target element, positioning, style, and text content to dynamically calculate the tooltip's dimensions and position.

By performing these calculations, the app ensures that the tooltip does not exceed the screen boundaries and provides an optimal user experience. Only when it's possible to fit the tooltip within the available screen space, it is rendered on the screen for the user to see and interact with.
